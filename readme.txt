* **Custom CSS Styling**: Add your own CSS to style the footer exactly how you want it

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use HTML in the custom footer? =
Yes! The custom footer editor supports HTML and shortcodes. You can create complex footer layouts with links, images, and more.

= Will this work with my theme? =
The plugin uses multiple methods (CSS, JavaScript, and PHP) to ensure compatibility with most WordPress themes. If you encounter any issues, you can use the custom CSS field to target your theme's specific footer elements.

= Can I have different footers on different pages? =
The current version applies the same footer site-wide. For per-page footers, you would need to use conditional logic in your custom footer content or consider a more advanced solution.
